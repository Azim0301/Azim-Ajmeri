                              <p>  Beat dhokla batter a couple of times to get air into it. This will make the dhokla fluffy. Do this before adding baking soda or fruit salt.
                                If the batter becomes frothy, do not whisk it more. It should be of thick consistency.
                                Always use eno while beating the batter. If you don't have eno at home, you can use baking soda and lemon juice in the batter.
                                Make sure that the steamer is heated for at least 4-5 minutes before placing the plates filled with batter otherwise it may take more time to cook and the dhokla won't be spongy.
